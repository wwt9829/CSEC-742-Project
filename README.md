# CSEC-742-Project
**Attack Defend Exercise for Computer System Security (RIT CSEC-742)**

**Gain understanding and experience with vulnerabilities and exploitation**

Construct a vulnerable system for others to attack and configure a monitoring system to observe attacks. Set up a VM, configure it to be
susceptible to an exploit, and connect it to the private subnet in the RIT Virtual Lab Environment. Attack other students' infrastructures
to discover their vulnerabilities, observe attacks against your infrastructure, and create offensive and defensive reports reviewing the
techniques you used or observed.
